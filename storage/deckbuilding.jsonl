Because every card slot is precious and battles end after 3‚ÄØPrize Points, effective deck construction requires sharp focus and synergy. This guide covers the fundamentals of competitive deck building in Pocket‚Äîplus advanced tactics‚Äîwithout excluding any Pok√©mon type or play style.\n________________\n\n\n1. Core Rules & Format Essentials\n* 20‚ÄëCard Decks ‚Äì Every deck contains exactly‚ÄØ20 cards, comprising only Pok√©mon and Trainer cards. Trainers are divided into Supporters, Items and Tools. There are no basic Energy cards in Pocket üóíÔ∏è.\n\n* Copy Limit 2 ‚Äì A maximum of two copies of any card with the same name can be included.\n\n* Prize Points ‚Äì Players win by earning 3‚ÄØPrize Points (1 point for knocking out a regular Pok√©mon, 2 points for a Pok√©mon ex).\n\n* Bench Size 3 ‚Äì You may keep up to three Pok√©mon on the Bench. If all your Pok√©mon are Knocked Out, you lose immediately.\n\n* Energy Zone ‚Äì Each turn you gain one free Energy attachment from a shared Energy Zone. Energy does not accumulate if unused.\n\n* Up to 3 Energy Types ‚Äì A deck may contain Pok√©mon whose attacks require no more than three different Energy types. Most competitive lists stick to one or two types for consistency.\n\n________________\n\n\n2. Pok√©mon‚ÄìTrainer Ratios\nA popular starting ratio is ‚âà 8‚ÄØPok√©mon + 12 ‚ÄØTrainers. Adjust to suit your strategy:\n   * 5 ‚â•‚ÄØ Basic Pok√©mon for stable openings.\n\n   * Focus on 1‚Äì2 evolution lines for consistency; avoid cramming several Stage 2 lines into 20 cards.\n\n\n      * A maximum of 8-9 Pokemon per deck is preferred, but the best decks have even less than that. Less Pok√©mon mean more consistency and a better deck\n\n      * Trainer slots should prioritize draw/search, type‚Äëspecific Supporters, and utility Items/Tools.\n\n________________\n\n\n3. Choosing a Main Attacker & Deck Theme\nPick one primary Pok√©mon (often a Pok√©mon ex) as your win condition, then build every other card to support that goal. Examples:\nAttack Style\n\tSample Main Pok√©mon ex\n\tKey Support\n\tAggro (low‚Äëcost, fast KO)\n\tPikachu ex, Buzzwole ex\n\tBench fillers of same type, damage buffs\n\tPowerhouse (build‚Äëup, sweep)\n\tCharizard ex, Gyarados ex\n\tWalls to stall, energy acceleration\n\tCombo/Control\n\tMewtwo ex, Venusaur ex\n\tEnergy engines (e.g., Gardevoir), healing or gust effects\n\tTip: Every supporting Pok√©mon should serve a clear role‚Äîbackup attacker, energy accelerator, wall, bench booster, or tech counter. Aim for Pok√©mon that fulfill multiple roles to maximize each deck slot.\n________________\n\n\n4. Mastering the Energy Zone\n         * Attach every turn‚Äîunused Energy is wasted.\n\n         * Streamline types‚Äîfewer Energy types mean a higher chance of seeing the one you need.\n\n         * Energy Acceleration‚ÄîAbilities like Gardevoir‚Äôs Psy Shadow or Supporters like Misty provide extra attachments and are crucial for energy‚Äëhungry Pok√©mon.\n\n         * Plan for Discards/Retreats‚Äîdiscarded Energy leaves the pool for good; use free‚Äëretreat options or Trainer cards that lower retreat cost.\n\n________________\n\n\n5. Staple Trainer Cards\nTrainer Role\n\tExamples\n\tWhy It‚Äôs Essential\n\tDraw/Search\n\tProfessor‚Äôs Research, Pok√© Ball, Pok√©mon Communication\n\tKeeps your hand flowing in a 20‚Äëcard deck\n\tType Supporter\n\tMisty (Water), Erika (Grass), Blaine (Fire), etc.\n\tExtra Energy, healing, or damage buffs for one type\n\tDamage Buff / Gust\n\tGiovanni, Sabrina, Cyrus\n\tPush attacks over KO threshold or target weak Bench Pok√©mon\n\tRetreat/Healing\n\tX Speed, Giant Cape, Potion\n\tMitigate retreat costs and prolong survivability\n\tTools\n\tRocky Helmet, Giant Cape\n\tPunish attackers or raise HP on a tank\n\tAdapt quantities: fast aggro decks favor more draw; evolution decks want extra Pok√©mon search; bulky strategies may include multiple healing Items.\n________________\n\n\n6. Meta‚ÄëReady Archetype Examples\n            1. Lightning Aggro ‚Äì Pikachu ex + Zapdos ex, aiming for Turn‚Äë2 KOs. Includes Lt. Surge‚Äëstyle Supporter for damage boost and maxes out draw/search.\n\n            2. Fire Mid‚ÄëRange ‚Äì Charizard ex backed by Moltres ex and Kangaskhan wall. Uses Blaine for damage and Inferno Dance for energy acceleration.\n\n            3. Psychic Combo ‚Äì Mewtwo ex + Gardevoir evolution line. Gardevoir fuels extra Psychic Energy each turn; deck packs draw and switch cards.\n\n            4. Grass Stall/Heal ‚Äì Venusaur ex with Erika, Potions, and Giant Cape. Focuses on longevity, slowly taking prizes while denying KOs.\n\n            5. Fire/Fairy Dual‚ÄëType ‚Äì Charizard ex + Sylveon ex for matchup flexibility. Requires careful Energy Zone management but covers more threats.\n\n________________\n\n\n7. Testing & Refinement Checklist\n               1. Track Consistency: Do you miss key evolutions or Supporters? Increase draw/search.\n\n               2. Identify Dead Cards: Cut cards that rarely matter in real games.\n\n               3. Cover Weak Matchups: Add tech Pok√©mon or Trainers that answer decks you lose to.\n\n               4. Follow Expansion Updates: New sets (e.g., Wisdom of Sea & Sky, July 2025) can shift the meta‚Äîadapt accordingly.\n\n               5. Iterate Constantly: Even a top‚Äëtier deck list improves with tweaks after each match.\n\n________________\n\n\n8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n                  * Over‚Äëstuffing Types: Two Energy decks sounds tempting but usually hurts consistency.\n\n                  * Too Many One‚ÄëOff Pok√©mon: Stick to a compact roster you can reliably draw.\n\n                  * Ignoring Retreat Costs: High‚ÄëHP attackers often need help switching‚Äîplan for it.\n\n                  * Under‚Äëvaluing Trainers: Skimping on Trainers cripples draw power and flexibility.", "metadata": {"doc_type": "guide", "name": "deckbuilding"}}
