Battles use compact 20‚Äëcard decks, automatic Energy generation, and a point‚Äëbased win condition, keeping games under five minutes.\n2. Components\n* Deck ‚Äì Exactly 20 cards (no basic Energy). Maximum two copies of the same card name.\n\n* Energy Zone ‚Äì A shared pool that produces one Energy automatically each turn.\n\n* Play Area ‚Äì One Active Pok√©mon and up to three Benched Pok√©mon.\n\n* Points Tracker ‚Äì First player to reach 3 points wins.\n\n3. Deck Construction\n   1. Build a 20‚Äëcard list containing only Pok√©mon and Trainer cards.\n\n\n\n   2. You may include at most two copies of any card sharing the same English name.\n\n   3. Every deck must contain exactly two copies of Professor‚Äôs Research.\n\n\n      4. Effects that draw cards (Pokeball, Professors Research, Sylveon EX) are to be considered very positively\n\n\n\n      5. During deck creation you select one or more basic Energy types; the Energy Zone will only ever generate those types.Energy cards do not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Game Setup\n         1. Each player shuffles and draws 5 cards. The app guarantees at least one Basic Pok√©mon (no mulligans).\n         2. Because the hands are randomly drawn, there is no guarantee of opening with the pokemon you want. Being able to adapt and having more than one win condition is crucial.\n\n         3. Both players place a Basic Pok√©mon Active and up to three on the Bench.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Turn Structure\nPhase\n\tActions\n\tStart\n\tResolve start‚Äëof‚Äëturn effects. (On the very first turn, the starting player skips their Draw phase.)\n\tDraw\n\tDraw one card.\n\tEnergy Zone Refresh\n\tIf your Zone was empty at the end of last turn, it produces one Energy that remains until used. If any Energy is left unused, no new Energy is generated.\n\tManual Attachment\n\tOnce per turn, move one Energy from your Zone onto a Pok√©mon (the starting player cannot do this on turn 1).\n\tMain Actions\n\tPlay Basic Pok√©mon; evolve ; play any number of Item and Pok√©mon Tool cards; play one Supporter card (total) per turn; retreat your Active Pok√©mon once per turn; etc.\n\tAttack\n\tAttack with your Active Pok√©mon if it meets the Energy cost (some attacks cost 0).\n\tPok√©mon Checkup\n\tResolve Special Conditions and end‚Äëof‚Äëturn effects, then check for Knock Outs.\n\tEnd\n\tPass to the opponent. Unused Energy still in the Zone prevents next turn‚Äôs refresh.\n\t6. Victory Conditions\n            * Point System ‚Äì KO a regular Pok√©mon: 1 point; KO a Pok√©mon ex: 2 points. The first player to reach 3 points wins immediately.\n\n            * Turn Limit ‚Äì Versus battles end after 50 turns, Solo battles after 30 turns; the player with more points wins.\n\n            * Running out of cards does not cause a loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Other key rules\n\n\n               * Weakness adds a flat +20 damage;\n\n               * Maximum hand size is 10; if you would exceed it, choose and discard until you have 10.\n\n               * Confused Pok√©mon that flip tails no longer damage themselves (the attack simply fails).\n               * Tool cards are played by attaching them to a Benched or Active Pok√©mon. Once a player attaches a Pok√©mon Tool to a Pok√©mon, the Pok√©mon Tool may only be removed by the effect of a card; removed Pok√©mon Tools are typically discarded, as are those attached to a Knocked Out Pok√©mon.\n\n               * Effects that target a random Pok√©mon are decided by the app.\n\n               * Attack locks (e.g., Buzzwole ex ‚Äì Big Beat Loop) end as soon as the Pok√©mon leaves the Active spot.\n\n               * You may play any number of Item and Pok√©mon Tool cards during your turn, but only one Supporter.\n\n               * Pok√©mon cannot evolve the same turn they are played. Stage 1 Pok√©mon evolve from Basic Pok√©mon, Stage 2 from Stage 1, or directly from Basic when you use a Rare Candy.\n\n               * You may retreat your Active Pok√©mon only once per turn.\n\n8. Frequently Asked Rulings\n                  * Zero‚ÄëCost Attacks ‚Äì An attack with no Energy symbols may be used at any time, including the opening turn.\n\n                  * Buzzwole ex ‚Äì Big Beat Loop ‚Äì Switching Buzzwole ex to the Bench removes its self‚Äëlock, allowing it to use Big Beat again next turn.\n\n                  * Scizor ‚Äì Gale Thrust ‚Äì The +50 bonus applies only if Scizor became Active during your turn before attacking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Status Effects (Special Conditions)\nSpecial Conditions represent persistent afflictions that hinder a Pok√©mon. They are checked during Pok√©mon Checkup at the end of every player‚Äôs turn, always in this order:\nPoison ‚Üí Burn ‚Üí Sleep ‚Üí Paralysis\nA Pok√©mon can be affected by multiple conditions simultaneously; resolve each separately in the sequence above.\n10.1 Individual Effects\nStatus\n\tIn‚ÄëGame Effect\n\tHow to Cure\n\tPoisoned\n\tPut 1 damage counter (10) on the Pok√©mon at the end of each player‚Äôs turn.\n\tEvolve, move to Bench, or attach Lum Berry.\n\tBurned\n\tPut 2 damage counters (20) at the end of each player‚Äôs turn, then flip a coin; on Heads, Burn is removed.\n\tSame cures as Poison, plus the coin flip.\n\tSleep\n\tThe Pok√©mon cannot attack or retreat. At Checkup, flip a coin; on Heads, Sleep is removed.\n\tWake via coin flip, evolve, Bench, or Lum Berry.\n\tParalyzed\n\tThe Pok√©mon cannot attack or retreat until the end of its controller‚Äôs next turn (guaranteed to wear off after one full turn).\n\tWait one turn, evolve, or Lum Berry.\n\tConfused\n\tWhen the Pok√©mon declares an attack, flip a coin; on Tails, the attack fails (it does not self‚Äëdamage in Pocket).\n\tBench, evolve, or Lum Berry.\n\t10.2 Timing & Damage Math\n                     * Because Checkup occurs on both turns, Poison effectively deals 20 damage per round (10 on your turn, 10 on the opponent‚Äôs), and Burn deals 40 if not cured by Heads.\n\n                     * Status damage is resolved before the next turn‚Äôs Start phase, so it can KO a Pok√©mon before you regain Energy.\n\n                     * Paralysis has the shortest duration: exactly one full turn cycle.\n\n                     * Sleep can potentially last indefinitely if you keep flipping Tails.\n\n10.3 Universal Cures & Tech Cards\n                        1. Evolve the affected Pok√©mon (removes all current Special Conditions).\n\n                        2. Switch / Retreat to move it to the Bench. Note: Sleep or Paralysis normally prevent Retreat; use cards like Koga or Switch effects to force a change.\n\n                        3. Lum Berry Pok√©mon Tool ‚Äì Instantly removes one Special Condition upon attachment.\n\n                        4. Wait out Paralysis or flip Heads for Sleep/Burn.\n\n10.4 Interaction Notes\n                           * Multiple copies of the same condition do not stack; only one instance is tracked.\n\n                           * A knocked‚Äëout Pok√©mon still awards points after all status damage is applied.", "metadata": {"doc_type": "guide", "name": "rules"}}

Because every card slot is precious and battles end after 3‚ÄØPrize Points, effective deck construction requires sharp focus and synergy. This guide covers the fundamentals of competitive deck building in Pocket‚Äîplus advanced tactics‚Äîwithout excluding any Pok√©mon type or play style.\n________________\n\n\n1. Core Rules & Format Essentials\n* 20‚ÄëCard Decks ‚Äì Every deck contains exactly‚ÄØ20 cards, comprising only Pok√©mon and Trainer cards. Trainers are divided into Supporters, Items and Tools. There are no basic Energy cards in Pocket üóíÔ∏è.\n\n* Copy Limit 2 ‚Äì A maximum of two copies of any card with the same name can be included.\n\n* Prize Points ‚Äì Players win by earning 3‚ÄØPrize Points (1 point for knocking out a regular Pok√©mon, 2 points for a Pok√©mon ex).\n\n* Bench Size 3 ‚Äì You may keep up to three Pok√©mon on the Bench. If all your Pok√©mon are Knocked Out, you lose immediately.\n\n* Energy Zone ‚Äì Each turn you gain one free Energy attachment from a shared Energy Zone. Energy does not accumulate if unused.\n\n* Up to 3 Energy Types ‚Äì A deck may contain Pok√©mon whose attacks require no more than three different Energy types. Most competitive lists stick to one or two types for consistency.\n\n________________\n\n\n2. Pok√©mon‚ÄìTrainer Ratios\nA popular starting ratio is ‚âà 8‚ÄØPok√©mon + 12 ‚ÄØTrainers. Adjust to suit your strategy:\n   * 5 ‚â•‚ÄØ Basic Pok√©mon for stable openings.\n\n   * Focus on 1‚Äì2 evolution lines for consistency; avoid cramming several Stage 2 lines into 20 cards.\n\n\n      * A maximum of 8-9 Pokemon per deck is preferred, but the best decks have even less than that. Less Pok√©mon mean more consistency and a better deck\n\n      * Trainer slots should prioritize draw/search, type‚Äëspecific Supporters, and utility Items/Tools.\n\n________________\n\n\n3. Choosing a Main Attacker & Deck Theme\nPick one primary Pok√©mon (often a Pok√©mon ex) as your win condition, then build every other card to support that goal. Examples:\nAttack Style\n\tSample Main Pok√©mon ex\n\tKey Support\n\tAggro (low‚Äëcost, fast KO)\n\tPikachu ex, Buzzwole ex\n\tBench fillers of same type, damage buffs\n\tPowerhouse (build‚Äëup, sweep)\n\tCharizard ex, Gyarados ex\n\tWalls to stall, energy acceleration\n\tCombo/Control\n\tMewtwo ex, Venusaur ex\n\tEnergy engines (e.g., Gardevoir), healing or gust effects\n\tTip: Every supporting Pok√©mon should serve a clear role‚Äîbackup attacker, energy accelerator, wall, bench booster, or tech counter. Aim for Pok√©mon that fulfill multiple roles to maximize each deck slot.\n________________\n\n\n4. Mastering the Energy Zone\n         * Attach every turn‚Äîunused Energy is wasted.\n\n         * Streamline types‚Äîfewer Energy types mean a higher chance of seeing the one you need.\n\n         * Energy Acceleration‚ÄîAbilities like Gardevoir‚Äôs Psy Shadow or Supporters like Misty provide extra attachments and are crucial for energy‚Äëhungry Pok√©mon.\n\n         * Plan for Discards/Retreats‚Äîdiscarded Energy leaves the pool for good; use free‚Äëretreat options or Trainer cards that lower retreat cost.\n\n________________\n\n\n5. Staple Trainer Cards\nTrainer Role\n\tExamples\n\tWhy It‚Äôs Essential\n\tDraw/Search\n\tProfessor‚Äôs Research, Pok√© Ball, Pok√©mon Communication\n\tKeeps your hand flowing in a 20‚Äëcard deck\n\tType Supporter\n\tMisty (Water), Erika (Grass), Blaine (Fire), etc.\n\tExtra Energy, healing, or damage buffs for one type\n\tDamage Buff / Gust\n\tGiovanni, Sabrina, Cyrus\n\tPush attacks over KO threshold or target weak Bench Pok√©mon\n\tRetreat/Healing\n\tX Speed, Giant Cape, Potion\n\tMitigate retreat costs and prolong survivability\n\tTools\n\tRocky Helmet, Giant Cape\n\tPunish attackers or raise HP on a tank\n\tAdapt quantities: fast aggro decks favor more draw; evolution decks want extra Pok√©mon search; bulky strategies may include multiple healing Items.\n________________\n\n\n6. Meta‚ÄëReady Archetype Examples\n            1. Lightning Aggro ‚Äì Pikachu ex + Zapdos ex, aiming for Turn‚Äë2 KOs. Includes Lt. Surge‚Äëstyle Supporter for damage boost and maxes out draw/search.\n\n            2. Fire Mid‚ÄëRange ‚Äì Charizard ex backed by Moltres ex and Kangaskhan wall. Uses Blaine for damage and Inferno Dance for energy acceleration.\n\n            3. Psychic Combo ‚Äì Mewtwo ex + Gardevoir evolution line. Gardevoir fuels extra Psychic Energy each turn; deck packs draw and switch cards.\n\n            4. Grass Stall/Heal ‚Äì Venusaur ex with Erika, Potions, and Giant Cape. Focuses on longevity, slowly taking prizes while denying KOs.\n\n            5. Fire/Fairy Dual‚ÄëType ‚Äì Charizard ex + Sylveon ex for matchup flexibility. Requires careful Energy Zone management but covers more threats.\n\n________________\n\n\n7. Testing & Refinement Checklist\n               1. Track Consistency: Do you miss key evolutions or Supporters? Increase draw/search.\n\n               2. Identify Dead Cards: Cut cards that rarely matter in real games.\n\n               3. Cover Weak Matchups: Add tech Pok√©mon or Trainers that answer decks you lose to.\n\n               4. Follow Expansion Updates: New sets (e.g., Wisdom of Sea & Sky, July 2025) can shift the meta‚Äîadapt accordingly.\n\n               5. Iterate Constantly: Even a top‚Äëtier deck list improves with tweaks after each match.\n\n________________\n\n\n8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n                  * Over‚Äëstuffing Types: Two Energy decks sounds tempting but usually hurts consistency.\n\n                  * Too Many One‚ÄëOff Pok√©mon: Stick to a compact roster you can reliably draw.\n\n                  * Ignoring Retreat Costs: High‚ÄëHP attackers often need help switching‚Äîplan for it.\n\n                  * Under‚Äëvaluing Trainers: Skimping on Trainers cripples draw power and flexibility.", "metadata": {"doc_type": "guide", "name": "deckbuilding"}}
